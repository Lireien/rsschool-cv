## About me:
I came from totally different fields of activity: veterinary and service sector \(manager in barbershop).

And what skills did I carry with me from these activities? Communicative and time-management, records management and conflict resolving. 

But why am I here now? Because of a strong desire to explore direction with a limitless opportunity to learn and develop. I choose frontend because I truly enjoy when I can instantly see the result of my work. And, yes, I know that it sounds trivial, but it's a fact.

So I started my way from programming school "TeachMeSkills" and successfully finished it. The way wasn't easy, but I think it's worth my time and efforts, because a new world open to me, is so exciting!

***************************

## Skills:
* HTML5, CSS3 \(Sass, Bootstrap, BEM)
* JavaScript\(Fundamentals, ES6+, DOM, OOP)
* Git, GitHub
* React \(Redux)
* VSCode, WebStorm

## Code example:

* The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be \{'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, \{}. *

```
function count (string) {  
  let result = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    if(result.hasOwnProperty(string[i])) {
      result [string[i]] += 1;
    } else {
      result [string[i]] = 1;
      }
      }
   return result;
}
```
